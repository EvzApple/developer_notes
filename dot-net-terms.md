# .NET

## Key Components 

1. Common Language Runtime
    - Like the "Java Virtual Machine"
    - A program that runs on a computer than knows how to run .NET applciations
    - .NET applciations are compiled to 'IL' Code (Intermediate Language), which is sort of like Java byte Code. Not quite compiled all the way. Half baked.
    - The CLR compiles the code the rest of the way using a JIT compiler (Just-In-Time)
2. Common Type System 
    - Freedom to use whatever lanugage you want, as long as it compiles to IL code
3. Languages
    - C# == C++++
