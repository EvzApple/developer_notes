# My Competencies

## Unconcscious Incompetence
> There are things that you don't know how to do, and you aren't even aware of that yet. (new stuff that sounds important.) Stuff to research or ask about.

 Well, you don't know what you don't know until someone tells you, right? Or you discover it yourself? 
- Definitely need to learn more about testing, but this course is definitely helping. 

- I need to dive more into Moq for sure.

- Markdown https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

- I would like to dive more into Blazor and Linq/Entity Frameworks as I will need to use these things on upcoming projects. I already took some Pluralsight courses (including one about Entity Frameworks by Julie Lehrman!), but I could definitely use more experience and explanation with that. 

- I would like to get better/more efficient at problem solving. I feel like I look at a problem and my mind races with a million ways it could be done, and then I have fear of how to proceed. Is that weird?


## Conscious Competence
> There are things that you are pretty good at, but it takes some thought and effort (might need to google a few things)

- Getting APIs set up and working between databases and VS is pretty doable for me...just need some referential materials to make it work 

## Unconscious Competence
> Some things are just second nature for you. They are like "muscle memory" - stuff in this list usually graduates from the Conscious Competence list over time

- I feel very good at basics: setting up classes, methods, all loops
